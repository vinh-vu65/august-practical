## Part 1

## Background

You take a call from a distressed client. The team member who usually communicates with this client is away at a meeting and will not be contactable for several hours. The client outlines several “urgent” issues that they want addressed immediately.

## On the phone

*   Answer the call as usual: “Hello, you’ve called August. This is Vinh speaking, how can I help you?”
*   The client may ask for the specific team member they usually talk to. I would kindly let them know that they are away for whatever reason and that I can help them or pass a message on.
*   It is key to listen to them as they outline/describe their issues, and take notes of any important details
*   My response would be apologetic and I would validate their issues
    *   Be patient, empathetic and understanding
    *   Acknowledge their emotions if they are displaying any in their tone
    *   “I’m so sorry you’re experiencing these issues, that certainly sounds frustrating/annoying etc.”
*   Clarify the issue and expectations
    *   Are there any more details I need in addition to what they have already described to me?
    *   What does the “fix” look like to them?
    *   What is the impact/severity of the issues?
        *   Is this affecting a critical part of their business?
    *   What is their reasonable timeframe to resolve the issues?
        *   Is this issue time sensitive?
*   Reassure them that we can take care of it
*   Ask the client what is their preferred method of contact and get their contact details to:
    *   Keep them updated and in the loop as we work on the solution
    *   Potentially get further information if required
*   Finally, ask them if there was anything else I could help with before letting them go.

## Next steps

*   Notify the usual contact person’s team and let them know the details of the call
    *   If they are unavailable, escalate further up to managers
    *   Work with the team to solve the client’s problem, if appropriate
    *   Ask the team:
        *   Who is the next available person with the most context to solve this issue?
        *   Do we need any further information before we can start investigating?
*   Refer to company policy/guidelines if applicable
    *   Has this problem occurred before?
    *   Is there any previous documentation that can help resolve their issue?
*   Working through the problem (if system related):
    *   Check the logs for any information about the health of the system
    *   Have there been any recent changes or deployments that could have introduced issues?
*   Keep the communication channels between the client and the team open:
    *   Let the client know:
        *   When we have identified the cause of the issue, and what our plan is to solve it
        *   When we have an estimate for when the issues are solved
        *   If we hit any roadblocks
    *   Let the team know:
        *   When the client provides any new information

## After resolution:

*   Follow up with the client
    *   Are they satisfied with our solution?
    *   Can we provide any reassurance that this won’t happen again?
        *   What measures/action items have we implemented to prevent this from happening in the future 
*   Review the issue
    *   As a team, review what went wrong and try to find the root cause
    *   How can we prevent it from happening again?
    *   Why did the client notify us of the issue, why were we not able to identify it first ourselves?
*   Document the issue and the steps to resolution
    *   We can identify patterns with this process
        *   Is this a recurring issue or just a once-off?
    *   We may be able to streamline our process to fix future issues of this nature
    *   Debrief/handover back to the usual client contact when they become available again
